# setup-swift-windows

with this actions, you can setup Swift environment in `Windows-*` runner of GitHub Actions.

Based on @compnerd's [install-swift action in swift-win32 repository](https://github.com/compnerd/swift-win32/blob/2f7c0b91e031fe3dc676042c3a429052e27f9969/.github/actions/install-swift/action.yml), but I added installer's cache, that makes faster to install and saves bandwidth of swift.org.
